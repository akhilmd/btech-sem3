Files in tmp folder must be redone to match above directory structure.
	[] Make seperate files for bubble and selection sort and corresponding test calls.
	[] Make seperate files for merge sort and corresponding test calls.
	[] Make seperate files for quick sort and corresponding test calls.
	[] Make seperate files for callbacks example and corresponding test calls.
	[] Make seperate array and 2D array pointer example and corresponding test calls.
	[DONE] Make seperate files singly linked list operations and corresponding test calls.

Instructions for adding new thing:
1. All related functions must be in a .c file in src/
2. All related definitions, constants and prototypes must be in a .h file in includes/
3. All generated .o files must be in obj/
4. Add your new files to be linked in the makefile
5. Test by running the folling in the terminal and checking if all files are generated.
	$ make
	$ ./test
6. Note that after implementing something, the corresponding test function must be written in test.c and called in it.
